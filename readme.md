# College Knowledge (Knowledge and Resource Sharing Platform)
---
A project to help new developers and programmers to get started with Development and Competitive Programming.

It's difficult when you do something for the first time. Like riding a bicycle, learning to cook or working on a new project.

So, CollegeKnowledge helps you to get resources for your projects and upcoming and ongoing coding contests on various platforms.
